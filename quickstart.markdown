**NoClass Quickstart Guide**

***To run the example***

1) Create a database called 'blog'.

2) If your server is running at http://localhost:5984/ you can now insert records into your 'blog' database according to the example class.

If you are not running a Couch server at the above address;

3) Edit lib/couchCurl.php - at the top is a COUCH_HOST definition - provide your server's url here, including a username/password if needed (recommended for insertion on public facing servers.)

As you create classes also create a same-named database on your couch server.
